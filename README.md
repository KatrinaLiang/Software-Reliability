# Software Reliability

## Lab 1: Glass-box Testing
We experimented with five coverage models node coverage (NC), edge coverage (EC), predicate coverage (PC), clause coverage (CC), restricted active clause coverage(RACC), and compared their performance for the Triangle Test Algorithm.

## Lab 2: Black-box and Requirements-Based Testing - Sorting and Searching
In this lab, we investigated the performance of random testing and pairwise testing to find injected errors in programs.

## Lab 3: Model-based Testing and Automated Test-case Generation
We experimented with model-based testing from simple state-machine models. A temporal logic model checker called NuSMV was used to construct test cases from test requirements. This approach represents the state-of-the-art in testing of embedded systems.
